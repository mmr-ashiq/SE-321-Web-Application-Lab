						Ronald Koeman’s underwhelming spell as the Barcelona manager came to
						an abrupt end on Wednesday night after he was sacked following a 1-0
						defeat at Rayo Vallecano.
					</p>
					<p>
						His departure ends an unhappy chapter for the former player who won
						them their first European Cup in 1992 and leaves the club in turmoil
						on and off the field. The defeat left Barcelona ninth in La Liga on
						15 points, six behind a quartet of clubs led by Real Madrid. Barça
						are third in their Champions League group having lost their opening
						two matches in Group E 3-0, at home to Bayern Munich and then away
						to Benfica. Ultimately, it was a sorry end for Koeman with the Rayo
						Vallecano supporters taunting Barcelona’s players and the manager as
						they left the pitch.
					</p>
					<p>
						“FC Barcelona has relieved Ronald Koeman of his duties as first-team
						coach,” an official club statement read after the 1-0 loss. The
						statement continued: “The president of the club, Joan Laporta,
						informed him of the decision after the defeat against Rayo
						Vallecano. Ronald Koeman will say goodbye to the squad on Thursday
						at the Ciutat Esportiva. FC Barcelona wishes to thank him for his
						service to the club and wishes him all the best in his professional
						career.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Koeman resigned as the Netherlands manager in August 2020 to take
						the helm at the Camp Nou in succession to Quique Setién, who was
						dismissed after an 8-2 defeat by Bayern Munich in a Champions League
						quarter-final played on neutral ground because of Covid-19. But the
						Dutchman was unable to arrest the decline as a financial crisis took
						hold, leading eventually to the departure of their superstar Lionel
						Messi. After a poor start to the current season – and with
						supporters calling for his head – it was thought that the depth of
						the financial problems were the only reason Koeman kept his job so
						long.

					<h6><strong>Farmer’s league meaning</strong></h6>
					<p>
						A “Farmer’s League” is a derogatory term used by football fans to
						describe a football league (usually professional) that they don’t
						consider to be competitive. Similar insults include describing a
						league as a “Pub League”, “Village League” or “Sunday League”. .
						Calling a league a “Farmer’s League” insinuates that its players are
						made up of local farmers rather than elite well-paid professional
						footballers.. Whilst farmers surely aren’t the only ones who created
						their own amateur leagues, they happened to be the unlucky party to
						get their league associated with a mocking term.
					</p>
					<h6><strong>What is a “Farmer’s League”?</strong></h6>
					<p>
						A “Farmer’s League” is a derogatory term – mostly developed by
						online football fans – to describe a league that lacks quality and
						competitiveness. Thereby, a farmer’s league is a competition that is
						usually pre-dominated by one or very few elite clubs, whilst the
						rest is made up of small hopeless sides with very modest
						aspirations. This slang is more commonly adopted by fans of the
						English Premier League, who widely consider their league to be the
						best domestic competition in the sport. Whilst it’s hard to argue
						with the EPL’s supremacy on both the sporting and the financial
						levels, referring to some of the other Top Five European leagues as
						Farmer’s league is undoubtedly a controversial statement, and can is
						often being taken as an insult
					</p>
					<h6>
						<strong>Which Leagues Are Known as a “Farmer’s League”?</strong>
					</h6>
					<p>
						France’s Ligue 1, Italy’s Serie A and Germany’s Bundesliga are
						sometimes referred to a Farmer’s Leagues by football fans, despite
						all being among the top five leagues in Europe., at least three
						leagues are being labelled as a “Farmer’s League” by a section of
						online football fans, although with varying degrees.
